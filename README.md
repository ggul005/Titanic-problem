## Titanic problem: learning from disaster

I have tried to solve the Kaggle's Titanic problem using Python
libraries Pandas and Scikit-learn. I have produced two solutions.
The first one scored ~0.77, while the second one (more recent attempt)
scored ~0.8. 

I am still wondering if there is a way to improve the score ...
