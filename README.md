## Titanic problem: learning from disaster

I have tried to solve the Kaggle's Titanic problem using Python
libraries Pandas and Scikit-learn. I have produced two solutions.
[The first one](Titanic1.ipynb) scored ~0.77, while [the second one](Titanic2.ipynb) 
(more recent attempt) scored ~0.8. 

I am still wondering if there is a way to improve the score ...
