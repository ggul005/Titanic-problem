## Titanic-problem-in-Python

Here I present two solutions to predict who survived
after the Titanic disaster. This is one of the Kaggle's training problems.
I used Python's libraries sci-kit learn and numpy for this task.
Random Forest algorithm was chosen to build the predicting model.


The first attempt Titanic 1 scored around 0.77 at Kaggle, while
the second attempt Titanic 2 scored around 0.8 at Kaggle.

I am still wondering if it is possible to imporove on that ...
